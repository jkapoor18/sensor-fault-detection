## Predicting Scania Truck Failures with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Scania Truck Failure Prediction Project, where we leverage the power of machine learning to enhance the reliability and efficiency of Scania trucks by predicting potential failures before they occur.

## Project Goal üöõ

Our primary mission is to improve Scania truck operations:

- **Proactive Maintenance:** Predict truck failures in advance, enabling timely maintenance.
- **Reduce Downtime:** Minimize unexpected breakdowns to keep the fleet operational.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize maintenance costs and extend truck lifespans.

## Approach üõ†Ô∏è

Our strategy is rooted in data and intelligence:

- **Machine Learning Models:** We employ advanced ML models to analyze historical truck data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract valuable insights from sensor and operational data.
- **Early Warning System:** Create alerts for potential failures, allowing for preventive actions.
- **Web Dashboard:** Visualize real-time truck health and maintenance recommendations.

## Tools & Technologies üß∞

Our toolbox comprises cutting-edge tools and technologies:

- **Python:** The core language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For building predictive models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning for complex pattern recognition.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and numerical computing.
- **Tableau:** Visualizing insights and real-time dashboards.
- **Docker:** Containerization for seamless deployment.

## Features That Empower üåü

- **Predictive Maintenance:** Detect potential truck failures before they disrupt operations.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Receive instant notifications when issues arise.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Make informed maintenance decisions based on historical data.
- **Cost Optimization:** Reduce unplanned repair costs and extend truck lifespans.

## Business Outcomes üìà

Our project delivers tangible business benefits:

- **Improved Reliability:** Enhance truck reliability and reduce breakdowns.
- **Reduced Downtime:** Minimize truck downtime and maintain operational efficiency.
- **Cost Savings:** Optimize maintenance costs and allocate resources efficiently.
